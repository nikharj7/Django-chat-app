Hi, Team This a basic real time django-chat-app task project where I use django channels 
Technology used - 
for backend - Django(Python web framework)
for frontend - Html, css, javascript

so start with the dependencies,

first activate python virtual environment
python -m virtualenv env 

if you already activate then ignore above else
cd env/Scripts/activate 

install all dependencies through

pip install -r requirements_asgi.txt

make sure if there is dependency conflicts try to uninstall them and again install them 


then start your server or run the application through 
python manage.py runserver
